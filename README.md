# Getchoo

Getchoo is a tool for parsing and extracting Cisco ASDM SGZ files. The SGZ file is hosted on the Cisco ASA's HTTP server and is downloaded/executed by the ASDM launcher at runtime. Researchers can either download the SGZ from an ASA at `http://address/admin/pdm.sgz` or extract the file from an [ASDM binary package](https://software.cisco.com/download/home/279513399/type/280775064/release/7.18.1.150) using [theway](https://github.com/jbaines-r7/theway).

The SGZ contains a lot of files. For example, the following file types are found in the pdm.sgz from 7.18.1:

```sh
albinolobster@ubuntu:~/getchoo/build/tmp$ find . -type f | sed -n 's/..*\.//p' | sort | uniq -c
  13472 class
      6 jar
      1 prop
      4 properties
      3 txt
```

## Sample Output

Below is an example of parsing the pdm.sgz from 7.18.1 that was extracted by `theway`:

```sh
albinolobster@ubuntu:~/getchoo/build$ ./getchoo ~/theway/build/output/pdm.sgz
